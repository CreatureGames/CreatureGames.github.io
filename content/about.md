## Origins

It all started with a little jam game called [The Creature](/games/the-creature), a week-long project made for a game jam in the spring of 2022. From there, our team grew in size and talent into what it is today.

We will be documenting our game development on our [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/creaturegamesstudio/), so make sure to follow us for updates!
