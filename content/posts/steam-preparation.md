We've all worked on several games before, but nothing prepare you for the excitement and effort of preparing a game for a Steam release.

<!--more-->

Business registration, revenue sharing, marketing assets, game trailer... the to-do list adds up quickly. Even though it's a lot of extra effort on top of our 2+ development timeline (which was way longer than expected), releasing a game on Steam is a dream of all of ours.

There's a sense of _legitimacy_ that comes with publishing your game on the largest distribution platform out there. We can tell ourselves (and others) "yeah, we did it."

Is it worth it?

You bet! Even if we don't make back the money from publication fees, business licensing, and domain registration, experience is the most valuable kind of knowledge. So even if the game doesn't sell, we're about to be rich.

Stay posted for updates on the impending release!
