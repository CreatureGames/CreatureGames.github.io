This game was sadly never finished. It would have been entered for the [Jame Gam Christmas Edition 2021](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-christmas-edition), but that would never come to pass.

This was the first project that Rylan and Josh worked on together, opening the gates for future (more successful) projects. The save Christmas game was created with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) without the typical niceties of a game engine. After failing to finish the game on time, they vowed to _not_ reinvent the wheel again and use game engines in the future.
